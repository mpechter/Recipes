# Recipes

This program will enable the user to:

 - View recipes in the recipes.txt file.
 - Add new recipes to that file. 
 - Select recipes from the list and see what they'll need to buy to make them.

##Project Goals

With this project I was hoping to refresh my memory of some basic Python concepts. I also wanted to test out some basic Git commands.

I also love to cook, so this is a handy tool for making a grocery list!

##Ideas for Improvement

This program accomplishes the basic task I had in mind. From here, I could deal more intelligently with units and combine items when they are duplicated. For example, if two recipes both call for a red onion, that item will show up twice instead of having its amount increased. 

It also does not provide the option of deleting or editing a recipe at this time.
